Addressing comments from ST&CSM:

Line5:
Added Shannon's middle initial and Anuk and Carrie to author list

Line 12:	Subjects vs patients
I've corrected this in that I've tried to use subject when describing study participants and patients when talking about CD more generally.

Line 18: removed "induction"

Line 19: sigfigs
Not sure of the issue as this is 3 sigfigs (and/or 3 decimal places) and consistant for experimental values throughout document.

line21: replaced induction with treatment

Line 32: reworded the text as described by strikethrough

Line 94: section in methods
Not everyone will read the methods so a brief description of the original study and response definitions is warranted for context in later results.

Line 98: redefining study definitions
waiting for email response
" we decided to make the change as individuals who started with CDAI scores in the moderate range (between 220-249) who went into remission (CDAI<150) were considered remitters, but not responders using the original definitions. This is due to using a decrease in 100 points as the response criteria, whereas the subjects I mentioned would have a CDAI below 150 but a change in CDAI ranging from 70-99. I am still ruminating over how best to address this in the text."

Could include original response results, but since they arent as good as remission or relative response they could also be omitted. May depend on the strength of our justification.

Line 109-110: wk 22 results
The week 22 results were not as promising as week 6. Adding week 22 weakens/obfuscates the story.

Line 212: "Do the predictive #s you got using clinical data alone match up with previous literature (i.e. previous attempts at predicting response to therapy in Crohn's using fecal calprotectin, CRP etc)? Would be worth mentioning."

Unsure and need to check this.
